    "- It measures the EDA activities, i.e. it measures the Skin Conductance(μS) which is directly influenced by dermal(sweat) activities.\n",
    "- GSR is one of the sensors usually used with other physiological sensors due to its insufficient data provision on valance level.\n",
    "- Simply, it provides data related to sensitivity/intensity of the emotion rather than taste of the emotion.\n",
    "- But the paper suggests that GSR alone can provide up to 99.44% accuracy for (happy-sad classification).  "

    "- **Features of GSR Signal**:\n",
    "    - There are two components derived from the GSR signals: tonic that is related to the slow changes and phasic connected to the rapid change\n",
    "    1. *Phasic Component*:\n",
    "        - It is related to Fast changes of the data.\n",
    "        - The phasic component is responsible for *skin conductance responses (SCRs)*, which are relatively fast variations in the GSR signal (order of seconds).\n",
    "        - SCRs are the fast changes or peaks that can be seen.\n",
    "            - SCRs can be divided into two:\n",
    "                1.  event-related SCR (ER-SCR)\n",
    "                2.  non-specific SCR (NS-SCR).\n",
    "            - ER-SCRs can be created in reaction to a specific event and they are the most frequent measure for relating changes in emotional arousal to particular stimuli in researches.\n",
    "            - *The apparent variation in ER-SCRs is SCR peaks that happen between 1 and 5 seconds after emotional stimuli begin.*\n",
    "    2. *Tonic Component*:\n",
    "        - The tonic component in a GSR signal is typically considered to be the background level of activity on top of which fast GSR responses emerge.\n",
    "        - Individuals' baseline tonic levels vary greatly, often ranging from 2µS to 20µS.\n",
